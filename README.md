# Conditional-Skill-test-1
In this conditional skill test, I am to create a conditional that checks whether season contains the string "summer", and if so assigns a string to the response variable that gives the user an appropriate message about the season. If not, it should assign a generic string to response that tells the user we don't know what season it is.

# Plan
This task I'm required to give in 3 variables:
- `season`: Contains the name of the season you're in.
- `response`:  Begins uninitialized, but is later used to store a response that will be printed to the output panel and contains the appropriate message about the season.

  # Algorithm
  Create a switch statement that puts appropriate messages into the response variable depending on what the value of the season is. The different conditional tests (and resulting responses) are as follows:
  - Summer: "This is summer, take out your sun shades."
  - Winter: "This is winter, take out your sweater."
